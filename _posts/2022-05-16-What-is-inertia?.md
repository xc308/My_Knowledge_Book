### Def: 
- Let $A \in M_n$  be Hermitian
- The inertia of A is the ordered triple $i(A) = (i_+(A), i_-(A), i_0(A))$, in which
    - $i_+(A)$ is the number of postive eigenvalues of A
    - $i_-(A)$ is the number of negative eigenvalues of A
    - $i_0(A)$ is the number of zero eigenvalues of A

- The signature of A is $i_+(A) - i_-(A)$
